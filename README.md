SKEP1.WGCNA.network
===================

##Network analysis by WGCNA on SKEP1 data

This project mainly applies WGCNA package to construct the network model.

The process of building the network model will following these steps below.

1. Prepare the data set which is the the contingency table composing the variables of the production situation and injury profiles. 
2. Correlation matrix from the data set
3. construct the network model and calculate the network properties, individual node centrality, module separation and modularity which generated by igraph, WGCNA package.
4. Building the randomize the network structure
5. Compare and find the independentable variable (cropping system and injury profiles)and dependent variable (yield)
